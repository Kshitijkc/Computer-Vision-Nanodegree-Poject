This is the final project submitted by me for Nanodegree.

Project: Facial Keypoint Detection

Welcome to the Computer Vision capstone project in the AI Nanodegree program! In this project, combine knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning to build and end-to-end facial keypoint recognition system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on any face and are used in many applications, from facial tracking to emotion recognition. Your completed code should be able to take in any image containing faces and identify the location of each face and their facial keypoints, as shown below.

Tasks
The tasks for this project are outlined in the notebook CV_project.ipynb in several steps. Follow all the instructions, which include implementing code, answering questions, and providing results. The following list is a summary of the required tasks (these are also outlined in the notebook).

Part 1 : Investigating OpenCV, pre-processing, and face detection

Step 0: Detect Faces Using a Haar Cascade Classifier
Step 1: Add Eye Detection
Step 2: De-noise an Image for Better Face Detection
Step 3: Blur an Image and Perform Edge Detection
Step 4: Automatically Hide the Identity of an Individual
Part 2 : Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect facial keypoints

Step 5: Create a CNN to Recognize Facial Keypoints
Step 6: Compile and Train the Model
Step 7: Visualize the Loss and Answer Questions
Part 3 : Putting parts 1 and 2 together to identify facial keypoints on any image!

Step 8: Build a Robust Facial Keypoints Detector (Complete the CV Pipeline)
